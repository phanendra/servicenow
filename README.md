💻 ServiceNow Project – Laptop Request Catalog 🚀 Project Overview

The Laptop Request Catalog Item is built in ServiceNow to make laptop requests fast, simple, and automated.

Traditionally, employees raise laptop requests through emails or manual processes — which often leads to delays, missing details, and inefficiencies. This project changes that by providing a smart Service Catalog item where employees can quickly submit requests.

The form is dynamic, interactive, and rule-driven with UI Policies and includes a handy reset button to start fresh anytime.
